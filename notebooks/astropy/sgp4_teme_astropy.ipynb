    "While this looks like some arcane cypher, you can read the orbital elements if you know where to look. Fortunately there are libraries in many languages to read this and output position and velocity in cartesian coordinates. Probably the most well known in Python is `python-sgp4` which you can find [here](https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/python-sgp4). This is based on the standard implementation documented in: \n",

    "Ample information regarding the origins of the software, its mysteries and the \"standard\" software can be found at [Celestrak website](https://celestrak.com/publications/AIAA/2006-6753/). \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem that many people don't quite realise is that the output of the SGP4 is the positions and velocities in an \"inertial-like\" frame. Furthermore, it is poorly defined. But, by far the most common mistake is to use it _as if_ this is a proper \"[Earth Centred Inertial Frame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth-centered_inertial)\", like the Geocentric Celestial Reference Frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rotation steps from TEME to the Earth based, rotating International Terrestrial Reference System (ITRS) are:\n",
    "1. TEME to TIRS\n",
    "2. TIRS to ITRS\n",
    "\n",
    "For those who would like to plot the satellites on a Latitude, Longitude, Altitude setting or to analyse the visibility from the ground, ITRS is the natural stop. For those who require plotting satellite orbits on a globe or analysing them for orbital mechanics calculations, a final conversion from ITRS to GCRS is required. While TEME and TIRS will be defined here as custom frames, `astropy` provides the ITRS frame and the inertial GCRS frames as well as rotations between them. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first step will be to define the SGP4 output frame, called (True Equator, Mean Equinox) TEME and the intermediate frame Terrestrial Intermediate Reference System (TIRS) (which, we will assume to be equivalent to the older, equinox based Pseudo Earth Fixed Frame (PEF))[^1].\n",
    "\n",
    "[^1]: For the pedantics out there, a reference system and a refernce frame are not the same thing, though I have mixed and matched a little bit in my text. Suffice it to say that a reference _frame_ is the realisation of the reference _system_. A wider explanation is beyond the scope of this practical coding example."

    "The second custom frame to define is the TEME frame itself. The general layout is similar to TIRS frame and, as the decoratior implies, the only way in and out of this frame is the neighbouring TIRS/PEF frame. The position transformation is a simple z axis rotation by an amount calculated by the Greenwich Mean Sidereal Time (essentially the angle defining where we are within the daily rotation of the Earth). However, the velocity rotation requires a correction due to the transformation between the \"quasi-inertial\" TEME frame and the rotating TIRS/PEF frame. The paper by Vallado et al. has detailed explanations into the mathematics and physics behind this.\n",

    "There are a couple of notes to add here. First, this example is primarily to show how a custom frame can be quickly defined in Astropy. While the example does work, a proper code would need to have some safety mechanisms for when the velocity vector is not provided or perhaps when the accelerations _are_ provided. Second, the \"self-transform\" functionality (to transform the coordinate to a different time in the same frame) found in other Astropy frames is missing.\n",

    "Finally this example code can be found [here in Github](https://github.com/egemenimre/satstuff/blob/master/examples/sgp4/sgp4_teme_gcrs.py) and the custom frame definitions are [here for TEME](https://github.com/egemenimre/satstuff/blob/master/src/frames/teme.py) and [there for TIRS](https://github.com/egemenimre/satstuff/blob/master/src/frames/tirs.py)."
