# satstuff
Bits and bobs regarding satellites. Python scripts and Jupyter notes, mainly.

The [examples](https://github.com/egemenimre/satstuff/tree/master/examples) directory has examples on `astropy` and some other orbital mechanics problems. Perhaps more explanatory stuff can be found in the [notebooks](https://github.com/egemenimre/satstuff/tree/master/notebooks) directory where Jupyter notebooks are stored.
